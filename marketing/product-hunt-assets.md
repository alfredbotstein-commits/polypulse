## 5. Maker Comment (first comment on launch)

Hey everyone! 👋

I'm [Name], and I built PolyPulse because I got tired of constantly refreshing Polymarket during big events.

The idea is simple: bring prediction market data to where you already are (Telegram), so you can check odds and get alerts without breaking your workflow.

A few things I'm particularly proud of:
- **Speed** — odds update every 30 seconds
- **Simplicity** — three commands, that's it
- **Alerts that work** — tested during some wild market swings

I'd love your feedback on what features would be most useful next. Currently thinking about wallet tracking (follow the smart money) and Discord support.

## 8. Common Questions to Prepare

**Q: Why Telegram and not a website/app?**
> Most traders already have Telegram open. We go where users are instead of asking them to check another app.

**Q: How is this different from Polymarket's own alerts?**
> Polymarket doesn't have native alerts. You have to manually check. We solve that.

**Q: Is this affiliated with Polymarket?**
> No, we're an independent project that uses their public API.

**Q: What about US users?**
> The bot works globally. Polymarket's own geographic restrictions still apply to their platform.

**Q: Why premium?**
> Infrastructure costs for polling APIs and sending notifications. Free tier lets you try it, premium is for power users.
