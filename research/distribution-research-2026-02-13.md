## 2. What Gets Traction on These Subreddits

### High-Performing Post Types (by community analysis):

**r/Polymarket & r/PolymarketTrading:**
- 📊 **Whale tracking / wallet analysis** — "I tracked 3,900+ wallets and here's what I found" (top post type)
- 📈 **Market analysis with data** — Odds breakdowns, arbitrage opportunities, mispriced contracts
- 🤖 **Tool announcements** — "I built a tool that..." framing (not "buy my product")
- ⚠️ **Market manipulation exposés** — Resolution gaming, whale influence discussions
- 💡 **Strategy posts** — "14 Polymarket trading strategies" hit r/CryptoCurrency front page

**r/CryptoCurrency:**
- Long-form educational content (500+ words)
- Data-driven analysis with charts
- Contrarian takes with evidence
- "I researched X so you don't have to" format
- Polymarket-specific posts DO get traction when framed as crypto/DeFi analysis

**r/SideProject / r/microsaas:**
- "I built [X] in [Y] days" launch stories
- Revenue transparency ("$X MRR in first month")
- Problem → Solution narrative
- Screenshots / demo GIFs
- Honest build journey (struggles included)

### Post Formats That Flop:
- ❌ Direct product plugs ("Check out my bot!")
- ❌ Low-effort link drops
- ❌ Posts without data/analysis
- ❌ Anything that smells like marketing

3. **Prediction Markets vs. Economists** — NYT just published (Feb 11, 2026) about prediction markets outperforming economists. Ride this narrative HARD.

7. **Whale Tracking** — "French Whale" Théo story ($80M payday) still generating discussion. Whale analysis = viral content.

### Content Calendar Hooks:
- **Daily:** Share one Polymarket market analysis with PolyPulse signals
- **Weekly:** Thread breaking down biggest prediction market movers
- **Event-driven:** Any major news event → "Here's what prediction markets say" (fastest engagement)
